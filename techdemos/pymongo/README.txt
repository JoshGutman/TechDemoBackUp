The following is an overview of the functionality of each of the files found within
this project:

    SimpleFileAdd.py - Demonstrates a simple pymongo file that generates a collection
    "files" within database testDB, and adds the file test1.txt to the collection.
    RemoveDatabase.py - Demonstrates a simple pymongo file that removes a database
    from the system.
    PyMongoTechDemo.py - File used to show the ability of MongoDB to accept and hold
    a file based on the user account. This information will be bound to the
    user information that is present within the database.

    Test1 and example5 serve as demo documents.
